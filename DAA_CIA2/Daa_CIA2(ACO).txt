In ACO, we define a population of artificial ants that move through a search space and deposit pheromones on the edges of the search space. The pheromones attract other ants to the same edge, and the collective behavior of the ants leads to the discovery of good solutions to the problem.

import random
import numpy as np

# Define the number of ants in the population and the length of each ant's solution
ant_count = 10
solution_length = len(features)

# Initialize the pheromone matrix
pheromone_matrix = np.ones((solution_length, solution_length))

# Initialize the population of ants with random solutions
population = []
for i in range(ant_count):
    solution = [random.randint(0, 1) for j in range(solution_length)]
    ant = {
        'solution': solution,
        'score': fitness(solution)
    }
    population.append(ant)

Next, we need to define the behavior of the ants as they move through the search space. Each ant selects the next feature to include in the solution based on the pheromone level and the heuristic information, which in this case is the feature's correlation with the target variable.

# Define the parameters of the ACO algorithm
evaporation_rate = 0.5
pheromone_deposit = 1
pheromone_decay = 0.1
iterations = 100

# Define the heuristic information as the correlation of each feature with the target variable
heuristic_information = [abs(df[col].corr(df[target_variable])) for col in features]

# Perform ACO for the specified number of iterations
for i in range(iterations):
    # Update the pheromone levels on each edge of the search space
    for ant in population:
        for j in range(solution_length):
            if ant['solution'][j] == 1:
                pheromone_matrix[j, j] *= (1 - evaporation_rate)
                for k in range(solution_length):
                    if ant['solution'][k] == 0:
                        pheromone_matrix[j, k] += pheromone_deposit / heuristic_information[k]
    
    # Initialize a new population of ants with random solutions
    new_population = []
    for i in range(ant_count):
        solution = [0 for j in range(solution_length)]
        ant = {
            'solution': solution,
            'score': float('-inf')
        }
        new_population.append(ant)
    
    # Move each ant through the search space and update its solution
    for ant in new_population:
        current_position = random.randint(0, solution_length - 1)
        ant['solution'][current_position] = 1
        while sum(ant['solution']) < 3: # Stop when three features have been selected
            pheromone_values = pheromone_matrix[current_position]
            pheromone_values[ant['solution']] = 0 # Disallow ants from choosing features that have already been selected
            probabilities = pheromone_values / sum(pheromone_values)
            next_position = np.random.choice(range(solution_length), p=probabilities)
            ant['solution'][next_position] = 1
            current_position = next_position
        
        # Evaluate the fitness of the ant's solution
        ant['score'] = fitness(ant['solution'])
    
    # Update
