Once we have the population, fitness function, and knowledge repository, we can use the cultural algorithm to evolve the population over multiple generations. The main difference from the genetic algorithm is that each individual now uses a subset of the knowledge repository to guide its evolution.

# Define the parameters of the cultural algorithm
mutation_rate = 0.01
elite_size = 10
generations = 100

# Evolve the population over multiple generations
for generation in range(generations):
    # Evaluate the fitness of each individual
    fitness_scores = [(individual, fitness(individual, repository)) for individual in population]
    
    # Sort the individuals by fitness score in descending order
    fitness_scores.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Select the elite individuals to carry over to the next generation
    elite = [individual for individual, score in fitness_scores[:elite_size]]
    
    # Breed new individuals by crossover and mutation
    offspring = []
    while len(offspring) < population_size - elite_size:
        # Select two parents from the population
        parent1, parent2 = random.choices(population, weights=[score for individual, score in fitness_scores], k=2)
        
        # Perform crossover to create a new offspring
        crossover_point = random.randint(1, individual_length - 1)
        offspring1 = parent1[:crossover_point] + parent2[crossover_point:]
        offspring2 = parent2[:crossover_point] + parent1[crossover_point:]
        
        # Mutate the offspring by flipping a random bit
        if random.random() < mutation_rate:
            mutation_point = random.randint(0, individual_length - 1)
            offspring1[mutation_point] = 1 - offspring1[mutation_point]
