In PSO, we define a population of particles that move through a search space and update their velocities and positions based on their own previous best position and the global best position discovered by the entire population.

import random

# Define the size of the population and the length of each particle
population_size = 100
particle_length = len(features)

# Initialize the population of particles with random positions and velocities
population = []
for i in range(population_size):
    position = [random.uniform(0, 1) for j in range(particle_length)]
    velocity = [random.uniform(-1, 1) for j in range(particle_length)]
    particle = {
        'position': position,
        'velocity': velocity,
        'personal_best_position': position,
        'personal_best_score': float('-inf')
    }
    population.append(particle)

Next, we need to define the fitness function as before, but now we also need to update the personal best position and global best position for each particle.

# Evaluate the fitness of each particle and update its personal best position
for particle in population:
    score = fitness(particle['position'])
    if score > particle['personal_best_score']:
        particle['personal_best_position'] = particle['position']
        particle['personal_best_score'] = score
        
# Update the global best position for the entire population
global_best_position, global_best_score = max([(particle['personal_best_position'], particle['personal_best_score']) for particle in population], key=lambda x: x[1])

Once we have the population, fitness function, and global best position, we can use PSO to evolve the population over multiple iterations. Each particle updates its velocity and position based on its own personal best position and the global best position discovered by the entire population.

# Define the parameters of the PSO algorithm
inertia_weight = 0.8
cognitive_weight = 1.5
social_weight = 1.5
iterations = 100

# Perform PSO for the specified number of iterations
for i in range(iterations):
    # Update the velocity and position of each particle
    for particle in population:
        # Update the velocity of the particle
        for j in range(particle_length):
            r1 = random.random()
            r2 = random.random()
            cognitive_component = cognitive_weight * r1 * (particle['personal_best_position'][j] - particle['position'][j])
            social_component = social_weight * r2 * (global_best_position[j] - particle['position'][j])
            velocity = inertia_weight * particle['velocity'][j] + cognitive_component + social_component
            particle['velocity'][j] = velocity
        
        # Update the position of the particle
        for j in range(particle_length):
            position = particle['position'][j] + particle['velocity'][j]
            position = max(0, min(1, position)) # Ensure that position is within bounds
            particle['position'][j] = position
    
    # Evaluate the fitness of each particle and update its personal best position and global best position
    for particle in population:
        score = fitness(particle['position'])
        if score > particle['personal_best_score']:
            particle['personal_best_position'] = particle['position']
            particle['personal_best_score'] = score
        if score > global_best
