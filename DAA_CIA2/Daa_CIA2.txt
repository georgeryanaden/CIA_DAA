The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a customer will take a personal loan based on their demographics and banking information. The input features include age, income, credit score, etc., and the output is a binary variable indicating whether or not the customer took a loan.

Here's a high-level design for a neural network using PyTorch:

1.Input layer: The input layer accepts the input features as a tensor.

2.Fully connected layers: The fully connected layers take the input tensor and perform a series of matrix multiplications with learnable weights. Each fully connected layer is followed by a non-linear activation function, such as ReLU.

3.Dropout layer: The dropout layer randomly sets a fraction of the input tensor to zero during training. This prevents overfitting by forcing the neural network to learn redundant representations of the input features.

4.Output layer: The output layer applies a sigmoid function to the final fully connected layer to produce a probability between 0 and 1 for the output class.
